    <h1>Roobet vs Gamdom vs Duelbits – Which One Should You Try First?</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve played on all three – Roobet, Gamdom, and Duelbits – long enough to know exactly how easy (or not) they are to sign up for, what bonuses you actually get, and which ones make sense whether you’re betting $5 or $5,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re like me, you want a smooth signup, quick access to games, and rewards that make it worth logging in. I’ve tested each site personally, deposited real money, claimed bonuses, and played both low-stakes and high-stakes sessions to see how they hold up.
    </p>

    <h2>Roobet</h2>
    <img src="/images/roobet.jpeg" alt="Roobet Logo" width="92" height="92">
    <p>
      Roobet’s signup is painless – you can be depositing and playing within minutes. The highlight for high-rollers is the fast crypto withdrawals and a VIP program that actually rewards big play. Low-stakes players still get daily rakeback, but the bigger rewards kick in as you wager more.

    <h2>Gamdom</h2>
    <img src="/images/gamdombanner.PNG" alt="Gamdom Logo">
    <p>
      Gamdom is the easiest of the three to get started on if you just want to test the waters. You can log in with Google, Steam, or email, and they throw free bonuses at you right away – daily free cases, “rain” in chat, and XP rewards. Perfect for casual players or anyone who likes frequent small boosts.

    <h2>Duelbits</h2>
    <img src="/images/duelbitslogo.png" alt="Duelbits Logo">
    <p>
      Duelbits is a great all-rounder if you like both sports betting and casino games. Signup is just as fast, and they give cashback on all bets – not just casino. Low-stakes sports bettors get steady rewards, while high-rollers can take advantage of tailored offers and VIP support.

    <h2>My Take After Testing All Three</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re new, start with Gamdom for the freebies, then try Roobet to see the difference in VIP perks, and finish with Duelbits if sports betting is your thing. All three sites were reliable during my testing – deposits hit instantly, withdrawals were processed without drama, and bonuses paid out as promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you play low-stakes for fun or push high-roller bets, each has a niche:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Low-stakes:</strong> Gamdom for free cases and rakeback, Duelbits for steady cashback.</li>
      <li><strong>High-stakes:</strong> Roobet for VIP reloads and bigger bonus offers.</li>
    </ul>
